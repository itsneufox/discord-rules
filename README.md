**- Rules -**

Staff have the right to kick/ban if they believe such action is justified. In general, warnings will be issued and discussed with users first.

- Respect - Just don't be a dick. Banter is fine but don't be hateful or harrass users.
- Topics - Conversations diverge and that's fine but if someone says move channel, move. Memes in #memes only.
- Hacks - Discussion of game hacks outside of prevention or exploit disclosure is forbidden.
- Selling - This is not a marketplace, we are not responsible for scams, discuss this stuff privately.
- Advertising - No advertising in DMs! Use #servers or #show-off
